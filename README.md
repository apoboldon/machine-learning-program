# Machine Learning with Python Program

Over the past years I have been teaching more than 300 people with 3.000+ hours of Private Tutoring Lessons. At the same time, some companies or employees had hired me as a consultant.

Everytime I made a lesson, I tried innovative ways to make people understand Python, Programming & Machine Learning at the same time, with practical use cases.

From all the materials I have received from my clients, I have condensed those notes and my experience in a program that doesn't stop improving.

You may well use it by `downloading` the `Code` or by `clonning` to your computer:

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:jsulopz/machine-learning-program.git
```

Start working on it and, if you've got some feedback to give me, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/W7XuejnRSJ)
