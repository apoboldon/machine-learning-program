# Resolving Python with Data Science

## About

This repository contains learning materials that will help you understand the core concepts of #Python.

At the same time, you will work with the famous pandas.DataFrame to manipulate & visualize #Data.

## Requirements

1. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed
2. Logged in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
4. Git configured in the terminal
    - Change the `MY_NAME@example.com` to yours
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
    ```
    - Change the `FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME` you yours
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
    ```
    PD: Don't remove the quotes from the command in terminal.

## Instructions

### Download the Materials

To download the materials, you have three options:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science/fork) to your GitHub account.
    - Later, you must clone the repository in your terminal.
    - Make sure you change `USERNAME` to your actual username:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/resolving-python-data-science
        ```
    - For example, since my username is `jsulopz`, I should execute the following in the terminal:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science
        ```

2. Directly **clone the repository**, without *forking* it. If you don't fork the repository, you won't be able to upload the resolution of the exercises for potential job interviewers to see what you are capable of.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science
    ```

3. Download the materials as a [zip folder](https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

### Interacting with the Materials

1. Each folder represents a chapter.
2. Each chapter may contain up to 6 types of files:
    1. `x_topic-y_**syllabus**.ipynb` to understand the practical use case and the concepts you will uncover as you interact with the chapter.
    2. `x_topic-y_**session_blank**.ipynb` to develop the solutions of the session notebook.
    3. `x_topic-y_**session_solution**.ipynb` to uncover the solutions of the session notebook.
    4. `x_topic-y_**practice_blank**.ipynb` to develop the solutions of the practice notebook.
    5. `x_topic-y_**practice_solution**.ipynb` to uncover the solutions of the practice notebook.
    6. `instructions.md` to follow a series of steps to complete the chapter.
